## Reflection

Working on this component library was a helpful way for me to better understand how React and TypeScript work together in real projects. Before this lab, I understood props and components on a basic level, but actually building reusable pieces of UI made everything click. I had to think not just about getting something to display on the screen, but about how to make it flexible, clean, and easy for someone else to use.

One of the biggest challenges was learning how to design TypeScript interfaces that made sense. I had to pay attention to which props were required, which ones should be optional, and how to use children properly. At first, I kept running into typing errors, but after reviewing the interfaces and making them more organized, the components became much easier to work with. TypeScript ended up helping me catch mistakes early, which made the components more reliable.

Another challenge was thinking about component composition—basically how components can work together. This required me to slow down and plan how data should flow between components. Once I got the hang of passing props correctly, it started to feel much more natural.

If I were to improve this project, I would add more styling options, create additional components, and write more complete tests. I would also like to practice documenting components the way real design systems do. Overall, this lab gave me a better understanding of reusable UI patterns and boosted my confidence using React with TypeScript.
